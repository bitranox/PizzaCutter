test file for function helpers/find_version_number_in_file

this is used to extract the version number from the CHANGES.rst locally,
so You dont need to set the version number in the PizzaCutter config file every time.
Thats much more conveniant.

the first line starting with a digit will be returned, until EOL or ':'

if no line is found, the version number 0.0.1a0 will be returned.

this file will return '0.0.1a0'
